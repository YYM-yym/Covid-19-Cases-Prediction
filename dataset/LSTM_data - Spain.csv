Nightlife is currently the origin of the epidemic spikes with the largest number of associated cases - an average of 31 - and moreover, these are the spikes that are the origin of a large number of community transmissions at this time and of cases in several autonomous regions. Accordingly, one of the measures consists of the closure of nightclubs, dance halls and late night bars with and without live music.
