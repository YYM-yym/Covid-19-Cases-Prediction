The Ministrys standing recommendation is that not everybody should be wearing masks. Among those who are not healthcare workers, only those who had a cough or exhibited signs of a flu or a respiratory illness need to be wearing them as did those caring for COVID-19 patients. The reason this isnt recommended for the public at large though now almost anyone on the street can be seen to be wearing them is that it will lead to a shortage and unavailability for doctors, nurses and other hospital staff. On Tuesday, however, the office of the PSA through the Press Information Bureau recommended the widespread use of masks. It endorsed, above all, home-made masks that could easily be made and were reusable with washing and sanitising. https://web.archive.org/web/20200520015039/https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-indias-health-ministry-office-of-the-principal-scientific-adviser-differ-on-mask-use/article31216536.ece",,,100,100,84.52,86.11,75,0.765,0.588,0.498,0.2,0.085,146,568,336,601,472
