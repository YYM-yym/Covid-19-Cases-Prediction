To carry out this test, it is necessary to go to an authorized public or private laboratory with a prescription from a physician. This test costs approximately 15 Euro and is paid for by the individual being tested. In the event of a positive response to the blood test, a nasal swab test (oropharyngeal test) should be promptly carried out to determine if the infection is active or if there is risk of transmitted it to others.
