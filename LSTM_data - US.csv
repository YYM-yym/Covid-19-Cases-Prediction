The order from the southwestern state, which comes into effect at 8am on March 24, means the number of US states ordering residentsto stay at their residences more than doubled on Monday to 15.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US has soared to more than 41,000 as of Monday, 579 of whom have died, according to John Hopkins University. That is more cases than any country after China and Italy, and the number of people who test positive is expected to continue to rise rapidly as the US ramps up the ability to test people with symptoms. New York is the hardest-hit state, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 5,707 in the past 24 hours, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Monday, bringing the total number of cases to 20,875.

""A $600-a-week federal supplement to unemployment benefits, enacted to address the pandemic, stopped at the end of July. That has pulled away a key source of support, not just for the nearly 30 million Americans receiving benefits but also for the broader economy. The status of the financial relief is a huge question mark hanging over the economy, said Daniel Zhao, senior economist for the career site Glassdoor. Mr. Trump said Saturday that he was taking executive action to provide unemployed workers with $400 a week in extra payments, on top of their regular state jobless benefits. He did so after talks on a new round of pandemic relief stalled in Congress. The Senate adjourned on Thursday until early September, and House members had already left Washington. The departures all but end any chance of a quick agreement on sending stimulus checks to American taxpayers, reviving lapsed unemployment benefits and providing billions of dollars for schools, testing, child care, small businesses, and state and local governments. In the meantime, states are scrambling to figure out how to carry out Mr. Trumps plan, with unemployed workers wondering whether the money will arrive in time to prevent lasting financial harm."" Timeline of implementation is also not clear: ""Even for those who qualify, it could be weeks or even months before they begin receiving any extra money. States will need to adjust to the new provisions when they are already overwhelmed by unemployment filings."" ""The program is retroactive to Aug. 1, meaning that workers should eventually receive payments for all of August. But Mr. Trumps executive action caps spending on the program at $44 billion, enough to cover five or six weeks of benefits, assuming all states sign up. That means the program could end almost as soon as it begins. It is still possible that Congress could either revive the original unemployment supplement though probably at less than $600 a week or appropriate more money for Mr. Trumps replacement."" https://web.archive.org/web/20200831044139/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus.html",1,Student loan reprieve lasts until September 30. summary: http://archive.fo/cZQtI,0,,0,,2,1,,3,,1,,,,0,,4,0,,,,67.13,68.57,69.05,70.14,62.5,1.457,0.874,0.454,0.28,0.128,44143,35581,33850,44639,38754
