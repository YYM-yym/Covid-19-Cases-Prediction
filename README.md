# Machine_Leanring_Project
CSCI-360 Machine Learning | 2020 Fall 
By Yumo Yao, Wanyi Yang

The project aims to predict the number of cases that will break out in the future based on the number of COVID-19 cases already available. We study the impact of case base, population density, GDP level, economy, political constraints, and policies on the spread of the virus in several major countries to predict the number of future case growth. It provides information for the government to issue restraint policies during the epidemic and alleviates the fear and anxiety about the unknown of the virus. We find data sets that quantify various policies and apply multiple machine learning models to make predictions.

Language: Python
